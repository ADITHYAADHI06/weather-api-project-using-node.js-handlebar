This project aims to develop a weather application using Node.js and Handlebars templating engine. The application will utilize a weather API to fetch real-time weather data and display it to the user.

Key Features:
1. Weather Data Retrieval: The application will make API requests to fetch weather data based on user input (such as city name or coordinates).
2. Handlebars Templating: Handlebars will be used as the templating engine to dynamically generate HTML pages with weather information.
3. User Input Validation: The application will validate user input to ensure it meets the required format (e.g., valid city name, proper coordinates).
4. Display Current Weather: The current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description, will be displayed to the user.
5. Forecast Display: The application will provide a forecast for the upcoming days, including temperature and weather conditions.
6. User Interface: A user-friendly interface will be designed using HTML and CSS, allowing users to input their desired location and view the weather information.
7. Error Handling: Proper error handling will be implemented to handle scenarios such as invalid input, API request failures, or network issues.

Technologies and Tools:
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side development.
- Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies routing and request handling.
- Handlebars: A popular templating engine for generating dynamic HTML pages.
- HTML/CSS: Used for designing the user interface and styling the application.
- Weather API: An API service (such as OpenWeatherMap) to retrieve weather data.
- npm: The package manager for Node.js, which will be used to manage project dependencies.
